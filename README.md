# Radix-Internship
Prototype of an implementation of a problem I solved at a previous internship

This was a project I did for the accounting manager at Radix Software and Engineering. As a consulting firm for many oil and gas companies, they would receive payment for various invoices that they sent out. As the head of the accounting department, it was her job to make sure that each of these payments matched an invoice, and that each of their clients had paid their tab in full for the provided service. At the time this was done manually through a shared excel spreadsheet that the department would match periodically. This project was done in order to alleviate the workload on the department by having a program first try and find the best case matches for each total payment to the individual invoices. I prototyped this project first in Python which I had familiarity with before having to port it over to VBA for applications, which I had never used before, with the help of another member on the internship program at Radix.
